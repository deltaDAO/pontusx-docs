# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) – Mainnet Migration

## General Questions

### What is the purpose of migrating to the Pontus-X mainnet?
Migrating to mainnet allows your assets and applications to operate in a live environment with real economic value, improved security, and interaction with other mainnet participants.

### What costs are associated with mainnet transactions?
Unlike testnet, transactions on the mainnet require gas fees in ROSE tokens. Ensure that your account has a sufficient balance before performing any operations. Publishing costs less than a cent under normal network conditions.

## Migration Process

### How do I prepare for the migration?
Follow these steps:
1. Test all functionalities on testnet.
2. Setup Production Wallets and ensure you have enough ROSE tokens for deployment.
4. Update your configurations for mainnet addresses.
5. Execute migration in a controlled manner.

### What happens if I experience issues during migration?
If you encounter issue reach out to the support team or request a 1:1 troubleshooting session.

### Can I roll back to testnet after migrating?
Mainnet assets exist in parallel with Testnet assets. If you do not want to offer any assets on mainnet anymore you can just sunset them as you would do on Testnet.

## Security and Account Management

### How do I ensure my assets are secure post-migration?
- Use multi-signature wallets for asset management.
- Store private keys securely in a hardware wallet.
- Enable real-time monitoring for suspicious activities.

### Are shared keys safe to use for migration?
No. Always transfer assets to a private address that you control to maintain sovereignty over your funds.

## Post-Migration

### How do I verify my migration was successful?
Check the following:
- Confirm smart contract deployment using a block explorer.
- Test asset transactions to ensure correct execution via the Portal or Nautilus.
- Validate API integrations and mainnet functionality.
