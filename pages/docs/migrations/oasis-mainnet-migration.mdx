## 2. Funding Your Address for Mainnet Transactions

Before publishing assets, you need to fund your institutional wallet with OASIS ROSE tokens.

Steps to Transfer Tokens
	1.	Log in to your assigned account.
	2.	Transfer OASIS ROSE tokens to your own controlled address.
	3.	Use your institutional address for all publishing and transaction activities.

**Security Note**: Shared accounts are considered compromised. Always transfer funds to a institutional account first before using it.

## 3. PTX Tokens – Usage & Acquisition

### What Are PTX Tokens?
- PTX tokens are used to log the price of assets in the ecosystem during the MVP.
- They serve as the logging token for exchanges and later invoicing.
- Logging Tokens will be replaced by e-money as soon as available.

### How to Get PTX Tokens
- Send your new wallet address to deltaDAO to receive PTX.
- (PTX will later be replaced by a stablecoin to ensure long-term pricing stability.)

### How PTX is Used
- For Nautilus Users: PTX must be manually set as the price token in asset configurations.
- For MVP Portal Users: PTX is automatically handled by the portal when publishing assets.

## 4. Publishing Your Assets on Mainnet

There are two ways to publish assets on mainnet:

### Method 1: Nautilus (For Developers)
- Recommended for developers who prefer programmatic asset management.
- Supports custom configurations, automation, and integration with existing systems.

**Resources**
- [Nautilus GitHub Examples](https://github.com/deltaDAO/nautilus-examples)
- [Mainnet Configuration File](https://github.com/deltaDAO/nautilus-examples/blob/main/config.ts)
- [Nautilus Setup Guide and Docs](https://nautilus.delta-dao.com/docs/getting-started)

### Method 2: MVP Portal (For Non-Developers)
- A user-friendly web-based solution for publishing and managing assets.
- Recommended for businesses and users who prefer a no-code approach.

**Resources**:
- [MVP Portal](https://portal.main.pontus-x.eu/)
- [MVP Portal GitHub](https://github.com/deltaDAO/mvp-portal)

## 5. Verification & Troubleshooting

### Final Verification Steps

After publishing an asset, confirm the following:
- The asset appears correctly in Nautilus or the MVP Portal.
- The asset can be accessed and consumed by other users without errors.

### Common Issues & Solutions

- Asset not appearing:	Check if the correct chain ID and configuration were used.
- Transaction failed: 	Ensure enough OASIS ROSE tokens are available for gas fees.
- Asset not consumable:	Verify PTX token balance and contract settings.
