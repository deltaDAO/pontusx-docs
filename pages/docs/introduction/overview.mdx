| **Component** | **Description** |
|------|-------------|
| <img src="/images/spaces-icon.png" alt="Spaces (data marketplaces)" width="50"/> **Spaces (data marketplaces)** | Data Spaces are independently governed ecosystems within [Pontus-X](https://portal.pontus-x.eu/), each tailored to a specific industry or use case, like manufacturing or mobility. They offer data marketplaces to find, share, or monetize data and services, under their own governance. Interoperable with other spaces via [Pontus-X](https://portal.pontus-x.eu/), they enable seamless cross-ecosystem collaboration. Learn more in *Use Cases & Business Value*. |
| <img src="/images/operators-icon.png" alt="Operators" width="50"/> **Operators** | Operators are trusted [Pontus-X community members](https://docs.pontus-x.eu/docs/participants-and-federators/ecosystem-participants) who provide core service, infrastructure, and validate transactions. Anyone can become an operator by following the [Pontus-X](https://portal.pontus-x.eu/) governance model, contributing to a decentralized network that ensures resilience, avoids dependencies, and prevents lock-ins. See details in [Community & Governance](https://docs.pontus-x.eu/docs/participants-and-federators/federators). |
| <img src="/images/providers-icon.png" alt="Technology Providers" width="50"/> **Providers** | Technology, standards, protocol, or service providers represent another crucial part of Pontus-X and its functionalities, like payment, network solutions, protocols and standards. Explore in [Technical Reference](https://docs.pontus-x.eu/docs/technical-architecture/architecture-overview). |
| <img src="/images/operators-icon.png" alt="Participants" width="50"/> **Participants** | Participants are businesses, researchers, or individuals who use [Pontus-X](https://portal.pontus-x.eu/) to share, monetize, or access data and services. They drive value by collaborating while keeping full control over their data. Join via [Getting Started](https://docs.pontus-x.eu/docs/getting-started/introduction).
