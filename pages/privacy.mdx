# 4. Processing operations according to Article 13 GDPR

Each time you visit our documentation, your web browser transmits usage data including your IP address and the address of the content accessed (URL). In addition, depending on the configuration, your browser transmits further data (browser type, browser version, operating system used, referrer URL). Our documentation is hosted externally by our service provider Vercel (see also chapter 3.1). 

**Purpose:** Collecting and using your usage data is necessary for providing our documentation because it is a technical requirement for ensuring communication between your device and our documentation. Your IP address and other log file data are also processed for security, fraud-prevention, abuse-prevention, and troubleshooting purposes. 

**Legal basis:** The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest, pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

**Legitimate interest:** Our legitimate interest is to provide our documentation to you and to enable security, a technically error-free presentation, and the optimization of the documentation. 

**Retention period:** Vercel retains your personal data for as long as needed to provide their services. Additionally, Vercel does not delete the data when it is needed for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. In this case, the information is retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims. 

**Right to object:** You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data (see also chapter 8.6).

## 4.2 Contact via e-mail

**Right to object:** You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data (see also chapter 8.6). 

## 4.3 Aggregated statistics
deltaDAO uses Plausible Analytics (see also chapter 3.3), a privacy-friendly web analytics tool for tracking overall trends in our documentation traffic. Plausible Analytics does not use cookies or similar technologies that require information to be stored on your device. Instead, the tool focuses on analyzing aggregated data without the need to access your end device or store information there. Plausible Analytics does not track individual visitors and does not create persistent identifiers. It does not use cross-platform or cross-device tracking and does not pass on data to third parties. Plausible Analytics primarily uses data that is recorded by default in server logs, such as requested URLs, access times, HTTP status codes and transferred data volumes. This information is used to analyze website traffic. Data processing at Plausible Analytics takes place in two steps:

- **Pseudonymization:** When the data is received, it is pseudonymized using a hash function and a regularly changing key (“salt”). This process aims to change personal data in such a way that data subjects are no longer directly identifiable, but a distinction between sessions is made possible.  
hash(daily_salt + website_domain + ip_address + user_agent)  
Plausible Analytics never stores the raw data IP address and User-Agent in logs, databases or anywhere on disk at all. 

- **Anonymization after 24 hours:** Within 24 hours of pseudonymization, the data is completely anonymized by removing the “salt” so that it can no longer be traced back to the original user data. The remaining data does not allow any direct or indirect identification of data subjects. 

Plausible Analytics only uses **EU-based service providers** for hosting and additional services such as CDN and DDoS protection. The servers are located in Germany (operated by Hetzner) and additional services are provided by Bunny (based in Slovenia). 

**Purpose:** We process your personal data to reach measurement and website optimization. 

**Legal basis:** The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest, according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

**Legitimate interests:** Our legitimate interest is to gain insights to improve existing and future features and services, and to evaluate user engagement. 

**Retention period:** As described above, your personal data is anonymized after 24 hours. 

**Right to object:** You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data (see also chapter 8.6).
